        <p>
            To love is to share life together, <br>
            to build special plans just for two, <br>
            to work side by side, <br>
            and then smile with pride, <br>
            as one by one, dreams all come true. <br>
            <br>
            To love is to help and encourage <br>
            with smiles and sincere words of praise, <br>
            to take time to share, <br>
            to listen and care <br>
            in tender, affectionate ways. <br>
            <br>
            To love is to have someone special, <br>
            one on whom you can always depend <br>
            to be there through the years, <br>
            sharing laughter and tears, <br>
            as a partner, a lover, a friend. <br>
            <br>
            To love is to make special memories <br>
            of moments you love to recall, <br>
            of all the good things <br>
            that sharing life brings. <br>
            Love is the greatest of all. <br>
            <br>
            I've learned the full meaning <br>
            of sharing and caring <br>
            and having my dreams all come true; <br>
            I've learned the full meaning <br>
            of being in love <br>
            by being and loving with you. <br>
